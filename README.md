MATLAB Programs â€“ First Year B.Tech

This repository contains all the MATLAB programs and concepts I learned during my first year of B.Tech. It serves as a structured reference for fundamental MATLAB programming and numerical computing concepts.

ðŸ“Œ Overview

The repository covers:
	â€¢	Basic MATLAB Syntax â€“ Variables, operators, and expressions.
	â€¢	Control Structures â€“ If-else, loops, and switch-case statements.
	â€¢	Functions & Scripts â€“ Modular programming in MATLAB.
	â€¢	Matrices & Arrays â€“ Matrix operations, indexing, and manipulation.
	â€¢	Plotting & Visualization â€“ 2D/3D plots, graphs, and data visualization.
	â€¢	File Handling â€“ Reading and writing data files.
	â€¢	Mathematical Computations â€“ Solving equations, numerical methods, and built-in functions.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
	â€¢	Build a solid foundation in MATLAB for engineering and scientific computations.
	â€¢	Organize and version-control all first-year MATLAB programs.
	â€¢	Create a reusable resource for future projects and portfolio reference.

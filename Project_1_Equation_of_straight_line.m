% Equation of a straight line: The equation of a straight line is y = mx + c,
% where m and c are constants. Compute the y-coordinates of a line with slope
% m = 0.5 and the intercept c = -2 at the following x-coordinates:

% x=0, 1.5, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 10.

m=0.5;
c=-2;
x=[0,1.5,3,4,5,7,9,10];

y=m.*x + c
